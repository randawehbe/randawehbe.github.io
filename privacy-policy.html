  <h1>Privacy Policy for InstaScheduler</h1>
  <p>Last updated: July 5, 2025</p>
 
<p>
*Last updated: July 5, 2025*

Thank you for choosing InstaScheduler (“we”, “us”, or “our”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding that information when you use the InstaScheduler mobile app (the “App”).

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. Account & Identity Information

* **Email address.** Collected via Google Sign-In to identify you and manage your account.
* **Firebase UID.** A unique identifier generated by Firebase Authentication.

### b. OAuth Tokens

* **Access tokens & refresh tokens** for YouTube (and other Google APIs you authorize). These allow the App to schedule and upload your videos automatically.

### c. Content & Metadata

* **Video metadata.** Title, description, scheduled publish date/time, and related details you enter in the App.
* **File references.** URLs and filenames for videos you upload to Firebase Storage.

### d. Usage & Device Information

* **Device info.** Operating system version, device model, and app version.
* **Analytics.** Non-identifying usage data (e.g. number of scheduled videos, success/error rates) to help us improve the App.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

* **Authentication & Account Management.** To sign you in securely and maintain your session.
* **Scheduling & Uploading Videos.** To schedule posts on your behalf, the App exchanges OAuth tokens with YouTube and Firebase.
* **Notifications & Reminders.** To send you in-app or push notifications about upcoming scheduled posts.
* **App Improvement.** To analyze aggregate usage patterns and crash reports.
* **Support.** To troubleshoot issues when you contact us.

---

## 3. How We Share Your Information

* **With Google.** We send OAuth tokens to Google’s servers only to obtain or refresh access to YouTube APIs, strictly under Google’s policies.
* **With Firebase.** We store your video metadata, files, and authentication data on Firebase (a Google Cloud service).
* **Legal Compliance.** We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of others.

We **do not** sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.

---

## 4. Data Storage & Security

* All data is stored on **Firebase Cloud Firestore** and **Firebase Storage** in Google’s secure data centers.
* OAuth tokens are stored encrypted using **FlutterSecureStorage** on your device.
* We follow industry-standard security practices (TLS encryption in transit, encrypted storage at rest) to protect your data.

---

## 5. Your Rights & Choices

* **Revoke Access.** You can turn off InstaScheduler’s access to your Google account at any time via your Google Account settings.
* **Delete Your Data.** Deleting your account in-app will remove your metadata and tokens from our servers.
* **Contact Us.** For data deletion requests or questions, email us at [privacy@postandshop.com](mailto:privacy@postandshop.com).

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Our App is **not** directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently done so, please contact us at [privacy@postandshop.com](mailto:privacy@postandshop.com) and we will promptly delete the data.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we’ll post the revised policy here with a new **Last updated** date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
